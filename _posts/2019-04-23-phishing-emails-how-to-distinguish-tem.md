Now the question is, how can you distinguish a harmful email from a regular one.

If your cyber security solutions – name them antivirus products, malware blockers etc. fail to protect, the only thing that stands on the way between the cyber criminal and you, is a keyboard.
People nowadays have no accessible tool that can guarantee that the person, sending an email is the correct one. A hacker could forge the email so that it will seem as if it is sent by a legitimate institution or a person. But it’s actually not.
This tactic is often times utilized when a hacker group has taken the hold of an email account. Usually the compromised accounts are company accounts – as people pay little to no attention in following the security best practices, accounts often times get compromised and fall into the hands of hackers.
When those malicious actors have established control, they observe the correspondence between all parties. The emails hackers pay close attention to include keywords such as ‘payment’, ‘invoice’, ‘price’, ‘transaction’, ‘bank’.
After figuring out that a payment is soon to be made, hackers begin using the ‘bridge’ strategy.
As soon as the fundamental points of the strategy are complete, hackers begin either a social engineering or a spear phishing campaign against the other correspondent or they await an invoice to be received. 
Forging an invoice is really easy. That is why, one should
<h3>Never wire a big sum of money before conducting a phone call</h3>
 
When a payment has been made, and if the recipient is fraudulent, one has a limited set of actions to do in order to recover from this situation.
But let’s not talk about the worst-case scenario. It is mandatory that everyone should know what to do, but more importantly, one should know how to proactively stop a threat before it’s too-late.
How do emails work is an article that will give you enough understanding and information, so that you won’t get confused by the acronyms and technical terms in the next lines.

<h3>Email servers with no spam filters - trouble for all of us</h3> 
Such email servers taht lack even basic antivirus protections or spam filters fall often times victim to spammers and phishing campaign.
Usually, a mail server should block and filter messages that have to <b>DKIM validation</b> or <b>SPF entries</b>. In most cases, email servers that are misconfigured, do a standard SPF check, but when the SPF check fails, the email server does not block the email message. So, a malicious perpetrator gains access to the ‘Inbox’ of the unexpecting user.
Every year there are spam campaigns against the biggest free email service providers in Bulgaria – mail.bg and abv.bg. The lack of validation puts the users to a tremendous risk. Fortunately, users of Yahoo, Gmail and Microsoft Outlook are protected from emails that have no DKIM/SPF validation.
So, the attacker has gotten in the ‘Inbox’ folder of some email. His email got an attachment that will install a backdoor to an unpatched system. It’s our task to stop him do it.
Firstly, in order to verify that the email is coming from a legitimate source, and not some dubious online anonymous email service, we should check the email headers.
Email headers can’t lie to you. If the SPF or DKIM validation fails or softfails, it is surely that the sender is not a recognized source of email traffic.
The sending server might also give some information. We could check what we know about it online in just a few clicks.
 
Only when you examine an email message closely, can you fully understand what was going on when the email was sent. But verifying this information by hand every single time there is a new message in the inbox, is a tedious job.
If only there was a way to automate this check, regardless of the platform.. Well, there is! And our tool is free. You can read more about it here and download the chrome extension for free from the chrome web store.
Only then can you be sure that even if your email provider is not secure, you will minimize the risk by using the best free tools in the market.
