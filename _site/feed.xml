&lt;h2 itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot; class=&quot;h2-heading&quot;&gt;Spear phishing attacks - the most dangerous form of phishing&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; id=&quot;business-image&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One of the most common methods cybercriminals use is the so called phishing – a cyber attack that is focused on getting access to one’s computer system, its passwords, also credit card data, bank accounts or other sensitive corporate information that could bring them easy money. To get this information cyber criminals are using email, social media, and any form of communication they can to gain access of and steal valuable data. You can find more about the broader term &lt;i&gt;phishing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;What do we need to know about phishing&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/2019/04/22/cyber-attacks-and-cybercrime-preventing-phishing/&quot;&gt;in our previous article&lt;/a&gt;

        <title>Distinguishing phishing emails from real emails</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot; class=&quot;h2-heading&quot;&gt;Detailed guide on distinguishing phishing emails from real emails&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; id=&quot;business-image&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/img/phishing-emails-distinguish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Phishing emails - how to distinguish them&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If you own a company or work for one, you know how business is organized – everything is happening via email. Meetings and discussions are just a small and harmless fraction of all emails that you receive. Well, what about invoices then? Are you aware that cyber criminals are sending fake invoices to companies and individuals? The amount of money they generate via this amazingly simple method is astonishing. If you want to learn more about this kind of cyber attack, I’d advise you to firstly read the articles about &lt;a title=&quot;Spear phishing and whaling article&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/2019/04/23/spear-phishing-attacks/&quot;&gt;spear phishing and whaling.&lt;/a&gt; They’ll give you a really nice introduction to this article.

&lt;h2 itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot; class=&quot;h2-heading&quot;&gt;Phishing campaigns - how do hackers plan and execute them?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; id=&quot;business-image&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/img/phishing-campaign-criminal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Phishing campaigns - plan and execution picture&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Real hackers plan every single step very carefully. What’s the trick, you’ll ask? Well, experience and common knowledge go hand in hand. And since hackers usually specialize at one area at a time, it’s really hard to know when one’s knowledge is sufficient enough and skills are technically advanced enough to conduct such an attack. Usually 95% of all spammers are just skids (script-kiddies are wannabe hackers with insuficient programming and systems knowledge). Yes, it may happen so that they catch a fish or two, but the really malicious actors are the one preparing months before a big hit.
Such a preparation has a lot of prerequites.

        <title>Cyber attacks and cybercrime: Preventing phishing</title>
        <description>
&lt;h2 itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot; class=&quot;h2-heading&quot;&gt;Phishing can't be classified as a real cyber crime, right?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; id=&quot;business-image&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/img/phishing-email-data-money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cybercrime phishing data and money&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This article is dedicated to the most commonly used and most preferred way to infiltrate any system – phishing. Perhaps you’ve heard of the phrase &lt;i&gt;“You give a poor man a fish, and you feed him for a day, you teach him to phish, you give him… you give him…”&lt;/i&gt; – well the whole world actually. 
Phishing is a type of cyber attack, that uses the weakest link in Internet – the human. Phishing is the most successful social engineering attack to extract user data – login credentials, user names, passwords, email addresses, as well as payment data and other valuable information.

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; id=&quot;business-image&quot;&gt;

Ever wondered how people got as far as they are? Well, we did. 
The never-ending strive to know how things function the way they do made us discover very interesting things. Judging by how fast the world is changing, the next couple of decades will be one hell of a rollercoaster - technologically, politically and economically.

But some things don’t change. As individuals, we have to satisfy different levels of needs in order to continue surviving and evolving - at least that’s what Abraham Maslow states.

The feeling of security several thousand years ago was something slightly different than now - back in the day people had no houses like us now, the only thing that they had was a tribe and some huts. And if we examine closely their habits, we will find a lot of differences with our current lifestyle.
